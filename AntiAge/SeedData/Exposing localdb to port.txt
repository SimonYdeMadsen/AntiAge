- Configuration Manager: Set network/tcp-ip/ to enabled and set port to non-dynamic instead of dynamic. 
- Create Logins, add UserMapping or just set all privileges. 
- Confirm Localdb connection using SQL Authentication now. 
- (Possibly expose port in firewall inbound)
- Use login in connection string.


In the end, this is a bad approach.
